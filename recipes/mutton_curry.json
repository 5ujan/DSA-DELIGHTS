      "Now, heat coconut oil in a pan set on a medium flame. Once it's hot, add the curry leaves and onions. Saute for a minute or two, and then add the ginger and garlic.",
      "Next, add the fresh coconut, tomatoes, and red chilli powder, along with the cooked mutton. Make sure to add the water with it as well.",
      "Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and slow cook for 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally in between.",
