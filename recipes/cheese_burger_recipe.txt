During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each beef patty and allow it to melt.
While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster.
Assemble the cheeseburgers by placing a lettuce leaf, sliced tomato, and sliced onions on the bottom half of each toasted bun.
Place the cooked cheeseburger patty with melted cheese on top of the vegetables.
Add any additional toppings such as pickle slices if desired.
Spread ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise on the top half of the toasted bun.
Place the top half of the bun over the patty to complete the cheeseburger.
Serve the cheeseburgers hot with your favorite side dishes, such as French fries or potato chips. Enjoy your delicious cheeseburger!
