        "Once the rice is cooked and the kheer has thickened, add sugar, cardamom powder, saffron-soaked milk, chopped nuts, and raisins to the pan. Mix well and cook for another 5-10 minutes.",
        "Remove the kheer from heat and let it cool to room temperature. It will thicken further as it cools.",
        "Serve the kheer chilled or at room temperature, garnished with more chopped nuts and saffron strands if desired.",
        "Enjoy the creamy and flavorful goodness of homemade kheer!"
